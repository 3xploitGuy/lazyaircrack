## Basics

> BSSID: Basic service set identifiers, it recognizes the access point or router uniquely because it has address which creates the wireless network.

> Channel: As Wi-Fi data is digital, the signals are transmited and received on a certain frequency also known as channel.

## Usage

The by default dictionary for cracking passowrd is rockyou.txt from linux, don't forget to replace it with your custom dictionary.

Note: at the end of the script all the log files are deleted, if you abort the script in middle for whatsoever reason - delete all the log files manually.

To get a handshake, there should be at least one active user using the wifi.

## Demo

A youtube tutorial of script will be launching soon.
